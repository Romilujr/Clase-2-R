## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}

library(readxl)
LA_MOLINA_2014_POTATO_WUE_FB_ <- read_excel("LA MOLINA 2014 POTATO WUE (FB).xlsx", 
    sheet = "fb")
View(LA_MOLINA_2014_POTATO_WUE_FB_)

```
